# Task Details

## Notes
Add field-specific update commands for AI-friendly task editing:
- mdtasks set-title <id> "New title"
- mdtasks set-priority <id> high
- mdtasks set-tags <id> feature,bug
- mdtasks set-due <id> 2025-10-25
- mdtasks add-note <id> "Additional note"

These commands are designed for AI usage rather than human editors
This approach is better for AI usage than opening editors.
